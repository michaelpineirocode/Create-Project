How to Simulate,
---------------------,
The simulation increments in days. Press enter to move to the next day.,
The best way to simulate is to press and hold the enter button. Hundreds or,
thousands of days may pass before new advances occur with the disease,
especially at the start.,
,
Each country's statistics are printed each day. The infection rate is the,
rate that people can become randomly infected each day. Chance of spreading,
is a metric between 0 and 10 which represents the a likelihood between 0 and,
1/100 that the infection will spread to another country on any given day. Even,
after all the people of a country are infected there is still a chance of,
spreading the disease to a new country every day. Smaller countries may look like,
they stalled at the start but they have not. Continue holding the enter key to,
and an individual within another country will eventually become infected. When country,
has been totally infected it is considered overtaken and will appear in a smaller list.
,
When a large amount of countries have been infected, holding the button,
may cause the screen to shake because the simulation is printing so much,
to the screen at once. Quit pressing enter to see the current state of,
infection.,
,
To skip to the end of the simulation, type "skip" and press enter. This will,
stop printing information about individual countries and continue the simulation,
without the need to hold enter.,
,
To quit the simulation, type "quit" and press enter. This will quit the,
program.,
,
Occasionally large advances will occur in the game. Type "ok" to continue,
when this occurs.,
,
Press enter to return to the main menu.,
