How to Simulate,
---------------------,
The simulation increments in days. Press enter to move to the next day.,
The best way to simulate is to press and hold the enter button. Hundreds or,
thousands of days may pass before new advances occur with the disease,
especially at the start.,
,
When a large amount of countries have been infected, holding the button,
may cause the screen to shake because the simulation is printing so much,
to the screen at once. Quit pressing enter to see the current state of,
infection.,
,
To quit the simulation, type "quit" and press enter. This will quit the,
program.,
,
Occasionally large advances will occur in the game. Type "ok" to continue,
when this occurs.,
